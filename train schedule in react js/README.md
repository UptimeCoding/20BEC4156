# Project README

## Install Dependencies

Check if there is a `package.json` file. If present, this means the project uses npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies. Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If there is a `yarn.lock` file instead, you can use Yarn as an alternative to npm:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run the Project

Check the README or documentation of the project to see how it should be started. Typically, there will be a section in the README that explains how to start the project. Common commands include:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

Follow the instructions in the README.
